The web site license allows you to use of all of the SoldPress features for a single fully qualified domain on one server.

Domain Format Requirements:

The web site license requires a valid fully qualified domain in the format of xyz.domain.ext.  For any licensed domain it will also work with and without the www subdomain at no additional charge.

Additional subdomains or fully qualified domains would require an additional license.

Valid Web Site License Examples:

domain.com / www.domain.com / subdomain.domain.com / sub1.sub2.domain.com / www.sub.domain.com

Invalid Examples:

192.125.28.25 / servername / server.name

Usage with SSL / https web sites:

Your single web site license will work with or without SSL for your licensed domain so a license for www.domain.com will work for both http://www.domain.com and https://www.domain.com

Note: A single web site license may only be used or installed on one server.
